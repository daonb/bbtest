BBTest - TestCase based black box testing and lab
=================================================

BBTest automation framework for black box testing and a virtual lab. The lab supports multiple Hosts & OSs and well as flexible network. 

The test cases themselvs are written using `bbtest.BBTestCase` as a base class.  Inherits from TestCase, so we use `setup` and `destroy` and `test*` methods.
To run the tests you can use your favorite python tests runner (ours is pytest).

We've added a class property `LAB` that holds a dictionary defining the lab enviornment.
