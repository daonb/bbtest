BBTest - black box testing
==========================

BBTest automation framework for black box testing in a virtual lab. The lab
supports multiple Hosts & OSs and well as flexible network. 

Our test case class inherits from :class:`unittest.TestCase`,
so you use `setUp` and `destroy` and `test*` methods.
To run the tests you can use your favorite python tests runner (ours is
pytest).
