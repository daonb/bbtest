BBTest - black box testing
==========================

BBTest s a python based automation framework for black box testing. Tests are
executed in a virtual lab, supporting multiple Hosts & OSs and well as
a flexible network.

Our test case class inherits from :class:`unittest.TestCase`,
so you use `setUp` and `destroy` and `test*` methods.
To run the tests you can use your favorite python tests runner (ours is
pytest).
